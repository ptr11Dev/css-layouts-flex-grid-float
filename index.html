          <span>Which layout method is the best?</span> I'm pretty sure the one
          that requires the least amount of lines in css to achieve your goal.
          In my opinion there’s a place for all the layout methods, and they can
          and should be combined where necessary. When creating a custom
          HTML/CSS website, I recommend using grid to layout your site, float to
          add that image to your blog post, and flex to get that tiny pop-up UI
          element looking fantastic!

          <span>Floats</span> are a great way to set an image within a larger
          text article. However, it’s not a very practical way to set up an
          entire web page layout. If you’re not careful, it can get buggy pretty
          quickly, and it’s a little bit of a mess trying to clean it up. This
          layout method just doesn’t have as many built-in properties as Grid or
          Flex and cannot create complex layouts. It's very important to
          remember that using float will take out the element of the normal
          document flow.

          The <span>position</span> property specifies the type of positioning
          methods used for an element. Element with this property are positioned
          using the top, left, bottom and right properties. However, these
          properties will not work unless the <span>position</span> property is
          set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.
          As well as float property this one takes out the element our of the
          normal document flow.

          <span>Flexbox</span> is a great tool to let smaller UI elements look
          their best on any device. Unfortunately if you want to layout larger
          elements on the page, you would probably want to add margins and then
          do a little math to make sure it looks the way you want it to look.
          That can take time. In addition, each section of your design must be a
          row with a separate flex tag on it. This rules out using flex for more
          complexly designed grid systems. However, it is actually because of
          the separate tagging that flex is seen in many frameworks and design
          systems.

          <span>CSS Grid Layout</span> is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can
          handle both columns and rows. You work with Grid Layout by applying
          CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid Container)
          and to that element's children (which become Grid Items). With grid,
          it’s easy to set up an entire layout design system for your website.
          On a macro scale, you’ll have your styling up and running in no time.
          Layouts may be nested within other layouts and grid also allows you to
          create extremely complex arrangements with precision. Although, it
          isn’t best for quick centering or placing an image within a larger
          text article. These types of layouts are best handled through other
          methods.
