## General info

If you still have problem with all the possible properties for grid, flexbox and floats - this is the place for you.
If you don't know why your elements are covered by other elements - this is the place for you.
If you don't know what the heck is clearfix - this is the place for you.
Using these simple tools you will understand and remember how each layout system works.

**Keep in mind that it's Desktop version only.**

Why is that?

I've created it to play around with layouts and to practise JavaScript. I guess most of you write code with access to at least one desktop rather than on mobile phone. That's the reason behind my laziness. Please accept my apologies.

## Warning

As for now _grid-template-columns_ and _grid-template-rows_ accept only repeat(x, y) function, where y can contain only one size.

## Technologies

- JavaScript - Vanilla
